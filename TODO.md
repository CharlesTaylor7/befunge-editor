- [ ] Evaluate testsuite. Eliminate low value tests, fix high value ones.
  - [x] Located a past commit with an extensive passing test suite: 1523f05
  - Current conclusion:
    - the testsuite from the CRA version can actually run and is well executed
    - The darkmode of the original CRA version looks a bit better
    - The functionality of the new Next.js+Tailwind app is better
    - The test suite was preserved carefully enough when I migrated from CRA to Next.js
    - The old README was much better and lost on conversion to Next.js

- [ ] CI for testsuite
- [ ] Automatic deployments via CI / Github Pages
- [ ] Explain Befunge briefly in README, and link to wikipedia
- [ ] Document existing feature set, and come up with a short list of bugfixes and simple usability improvements.


# Features
- [ ] Prepopulate app with interesting befunge programs.
